# JavaFX Search Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Description
JavaFX Search Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive application designed to visually demonstrate how various search algorithms work in a grid-based environment. This project is currently in the initial stages of development.

## Features
- **Visual Grid**: An `n * m` grid where the search algorithm operates.
- **Dynamic Grid Size**: Ability to change the dimensions of the grid through user input.
- **Speed Control**: A slider to adjust the speed of the algorithm.
- **Interactive Cells**: Users can set the starting point, end point, and obstacles on the grid.
